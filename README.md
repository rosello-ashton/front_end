# Program & Subject Offerings UI (React + Vite)

This workspace is a frontend‑only demo of an academic offerings system. It includes:

- **Dashboard**: summary stats and a simple chart
- **Program offerings**: listing, filters, detail modal
- **Subject offerings**: listing, filters, detail modal

Data is mocked via JSON files under `src/data`. No backend is used.

Use `npm run dev` to start the development server and open `http://localhost:5173`.

### Folder structure

```
src/
  components/      # UI components (Dashboard, lists, cards, details, filters)
  data/            # mock JSON data for programs & subjects
  App.jsx          # main entry with view state and modals
  main.jsx
```

The rest of this README is the original Vite template information. Feel free to scroll.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
